Example which run typescript must compole to javascript

1. enter folder which want to compile -> example: cd example/sumArr -> tsc sumArr.ts 
2. If already to compile, the file javascript will show for later running the program
3. If it already filed .js, it now will compile to the command line within a way node sumArr.js
4. If success shows the result 

I'm sorry if there's something wrong in the tutorial for running 
Thank You.
